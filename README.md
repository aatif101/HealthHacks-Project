Doctor Personas is an AI-powered medical assistant that simulates the reasoning of real-world specialists using retrieval-augmented generation (RAG).
Users can describe symptoms and interact with dynamic doctor personas visualized on a 3D globe, each trained on the expertise, publications, and focus areas of real clinicians.
